# Tech Challenge - Rather Labs - Full Stack Developer

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

The project includes the following packages:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

Yet I only use Next.js and Tailwind CSS from this stack. Apart from that, I use [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for context management and Ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain & ecosystem. I could have used Wagmi or any other similar library and save some time but for this particular project I thought of using Ethers.js and writing my own hooks.
